# Implementation Plan (pointer)

This repository uses `AI_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as the canonical, detailed implementation plan for development and automation.

**Canonical plan:** `AI_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Notes:**
- A previous high-level plan (`implementation_plan.md`) was moved to `doc/archive/implementation_plan.md` for archival.
- The `.agent/rules/fyp.md` file expects `implementation-plan.md` to exist and reference the canonical plan; this file acts as that pointer.
