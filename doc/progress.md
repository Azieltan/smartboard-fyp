---

## Session 24: Group Invitation System Testing & Auth Fix (2026-02-09)

### Backend Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive test script (`apps/backend/test-api.ts`) to verify invitation flow
- ✅ Test Results: **ALL PASSING**
  - User registration and authentication working
  - Group creation working
  - Invitation sending working (`POST /groups/:groupId/invite`)
  - Invitation retrieval working (`GET /groups/:userId/invitations`)
  - Invitations correctly stored with `status: 'invited'`

### Backend Fixes
- ✅ **AuthService.register**: Modified to return `{user, token}` instead of just `User` for consistency with login method
- ✅ **GroupService**: Confirmed all invitation methods working correctly:
  - `inviteUser()` - sends invitation
  - `getUserInvitations()` - retrieves pending invitations
  - `acceptInvitation()` - accepts invitation
  - `declineInvitation()` - declines invitation

### Frontend Status
- ⚠️ **Needs Manual Testing**: Browser automation tool unavailable
- Frontend code appears correct based on code review:
  - `ChatPage.tsx` fetches invitations via `api.get(\`/groups/\${uid}/invitations\`)`
  - Displays invitations in sidebar with Accept/Decline buttons
  - Handles accept/decline actions correctly

### Next Steps for User
**Please manually test the invitation flow:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/chat in your browser
2. Check browser console (F12) for any errors
3. Try inviting a user to a group using the "Add Member" modal
4. Check if the invited user sees the invitation in their chat sidebar
5. Test accepting/declining invitations
6. Report any errors or unexpected behavior

## 2026-02-08: Fixed Admin Create User & Verified Invitation Flow

### Backend Fixes
- **Admin Create User**: Fixed duplicate key value violates unique constraint error in AdminService.createUser by switching from insert to upsert. This handles cases where Supabase triggers might partialy create user records.
- **Verification**: Created and ran pps/backend/create-admin.ts to ensure an admin user exists for testing.

### Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: ran pps/backend/test-comprehensive.ts successfully.
  - **Admin Create User**: Verified creating a new user via API works correctly (login successful).
  - **Group Invitation**: Verified the full flow: create group -> invite user -> receive invitation -> accept invitation -> become member. All passed.



## 2026-02-09: Fixed Realtime Group Invitations

### Issue
- User reported that group invitations were not appearing for the invited user in real-time.
- The user had to manually refresh the page to see the invitation.

### Resolution
- **Frontend (ChatPage)**:
  - Added socket listeners for 
otification:group_invite and 
otification:friend_request.
  - Upon receiving these events, the ChatPage now immediately refetches invitations and friend requests.
  - Ensured proper cleanup of socket listeners to prevent duplicates.
  
- **Verified Backend Logic**:
  - Confirmed GroupService.addMember (called by invite) emits the 
otification:group_invite event correctly.
  - Confirmed FriendService emits 
otification:friend_request.

Now, when a Group Owner invites a user, the invitee's interface will update instantly showing the invitation card with 'Accept' and 'Reject' buttons.


## 2026-02-09: Fixed Critical Socket Notification Issue

### Issue
- User reported 'notification popup will cross to other user', meaning notifications were being broadcast to the wrong user session.
- This was happening because the Socket.IO connection (a singleton) was joining 'User A' room on login, but **never leaving it** on logout or user switch.
- When 'User B' logged in on the same browser session, the socket joined 'User B' room but remained in 'User A' room, receiving both sets of notifications.

### Resolution
- **Frontend (NotificationManager)**: Added socket.emit('leave_room', userId) to the useEffect cleanup function.
- **Frontend (Sidebar)**: Added socket.emit('leave_room', userId) to the useEffect cleanup function.

This ensures that when a component unmounts (e.g., page navigation, logout) or the user ID changes, the socket unsubscribes from the old user's notification channel. This fixes the privacy/cross-talk bug and ensures that invitation notifications (which rely on this channel) are delivered to the correct active user.
